This update adds the WMP library for ENDF/B-VIII.0. It converts ENDF into WMP for 548 out of 556 nuclides in ENDF/B-VIII.0. The remaining nuclides are: Ar36, Ar38, S36, Xe123, Nd143, Sm149, Ta180 and Am244, which failed in the curve fitting procedure due to discontinuities in the reaction cross sections of (n, a) or (n, p).
